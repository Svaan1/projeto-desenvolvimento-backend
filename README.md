# Spotifydle

This project is a game based on the Spotify API that offers two modes of gameplay:

## Game Modes

1. **Singleplayer**: Guess the correct song based on metadata.
2. **Multiplayer**: All players connect to a room and a song will be picked from one of the player's liked songs. Everyone tries to guess who the song belongs to.

## How to Use

To run this application, create a .env based on the example and use Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up
```
